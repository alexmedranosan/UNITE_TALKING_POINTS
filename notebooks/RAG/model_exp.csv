It is based on Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) that have been trained with billions of web pages, books or conversations. The field has seen several breakthroughs in the last 6 months.
In particular, a tool called ChatGPT has grasped public attention because of its surprising ability to generate text in a variety of ways: from news articles to cover letters, poetry, meeting agendas, games, or homework assignments of high school students. It can also carry a convincing conversation with humans.
OpenAI is a non-profit organization that aims to advance 'friendly AI' and make it available to the world equally.
Microsoft has invested heavily in OpenAI and is therefore allowed to use the technology in its products - such as an automatic meeting summarization feature for Microsoft Teams and integration in its search. Other companies such as Google and Facebook have since released similar tools.
Many time-consuming tasks of UN staff such as preparing meeting summaries, reports, research papers and talking points can be carried out by Generative AI tools. Automated translation is another promising use-case.

One key area of work, aimed at improving the timely detection and response has been the expansion and consolidation for the deployment of the “threat hunting solution” that has been developed i-house, based on leading methodologies and a combination of commercial and open-source tools.
Another main area or work consisted of the global deployment of advanced security tools for Microsoft systems, the so called “E5 security suite”.  The components to provide advanced security for email and collaboration services have been deployed across the Secretariat. The deployment of the advanced security solution for laptops and the remaining desktop computers is ongoing, so far approximately 45,000 devices have been enrolled.
This not only significantly increased the level of protection, but also the visibility into the threat environment and resilience of the ICT environment.
The suite also includes the capability to perform “fake phishing” exercises, that test the susceptibility of the Secretariat’s workforce against phishing attacks. The first comprehensive test against the entire user base of the Secretariat was performed during the second half of 2023.
The results demonstrate the high level of risk – about 6% of accounts would have been successfully compromised, about twice the numbers compared to global averages.  The solution includes the ability to offer additional targeted training to users who failed the test to increase awareness and preparedness.
