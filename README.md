# Unite Talking Points

The aim of the project is to use Large Language Models (LLMs), to speed up the process of generating talking points,
improving the efficiency, maintaining quality and consistency and being customizable and adaptable with Natural Language
feedback. 

## Description

The existing process of creating briefing notes and talking points often involves repetitive tasks, as similar
information needs to be incorporated across multiple documents. This process can be highly labor-intensive, requiring
substantial time and effort from professionals who could otherwise focus on more strategic and impactful activities.
This project aims to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to speed up the process of generating talking points, improving
the efficiency, maintaining quality and consistency, and being customizable and adaptable with Natural Language
feedback.
